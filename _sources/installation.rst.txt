Installation
============

Linux
-----

The PASTIS framework can be installed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pastis-framework

The Pypi package will install all Python dependencies.
Fuzzing engines then requires installing the appropriate fuzzer.
Supported fuzzers are:

* TritonDSE *(installed via the Pypi package)*
* AFL++ (see: :ref:`aflpp_install`)
* Honggfuzz (see. :ref:`honggfuzz_install`)

Other Platforms
---------------

PASTIS has not been tested on other platforms.
